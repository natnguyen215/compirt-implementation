# CompIRT Experiment Report

**Evaluation regime: transductive temporal holdout.** Returning-player priors come from the training split, but question parameters are co-estimated on the test-split outcomes being scored (paper Section 4.2), so these metrics are not fully inductive predictions of unseen questions.

## Tossup Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | accuracy | buzz_position_mae | buzz_position_median_absolute_error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.674274 | 0.595258 | 0.133279 | 0.708795 | 0.133093 | 0.11048 |

## Bonus Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | part_accuracy | part_accuracy_macro_team | part_accuracy_macro_game | part_accuracy_macro_bonus | exact_acc | ppb_mae |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.937103 | 0.328551 | 0.0350151 | 0.858895 | 0.86042 | 0.859296 | 0.86947 | 0.625583 | 0.690905 |

Generated figures include aggregate and buzz-position-stratified reliability, tossup difficulty over empirical buzz locations, per-dimension difficulty overlays for multidim fits, predicted-versus-empirical buzz timing, bonus-score predictions, and player, tossup, bonus-part, and optional synergy parameter distributions.
