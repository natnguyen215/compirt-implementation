# CompIRT Experiment Report

**Evaluation regime: transductive temporal holdout.** Returning-player priors come from the training split, but question parameters are co-estimated on the test-split outcomes being scored (paper Section 4.2), so these metrics are not fully inductive predictions of unseen questions.

**Correctness calibration was fit on the scored outcomes.** This run learned a Platt scale/bias on the same split these metrics score, so tossup ECE and log loss are flattered by construction and are not comparable to uncalibrated runs.

## Tossup Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | accuracy | buzz_position_mae | buzz_position_median_absolute_error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.600306 | 0.529003 | 0.0148788 | 0.770414 | 0.135113 | 0.114952 |

## Bonus Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | part_accuracy | part_accuracy_macro_team | part_accuracy_macro_game | part_accuracy_macro_bonus | exact_acc | ppb_mae |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.912494 | 0.376319 | 0.0210548 | 0.82847 | 0.829393 | 0.82871 | 0.836547 | 0.554422 | 2.10351 |

Generated figures include aggregate and buzz-position-stratified reliability, tossup difficulty over empirical buzz locations, per-dimension difficulty overlays for multidim fits, predicted-versus-empirical buzz timing, bonus-score predictions, and player, tossup, bonus-part, and optional synergy parameter distributions.
