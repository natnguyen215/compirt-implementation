# CompIRT Experiment Report

**Evaluation regime: transductive temporal holdout.** Returning-player priors come from the training split, but question parameters are co-estimated on the test-split outcomes being scored (paper Section 4.2), so these metrics are not fully inductive predictions of unseen questions.

## Tossup Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | accuracy | buzz_position_mae | buzz_position_median_absolute_error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.675944 | 0.596942 | 0.137716 | 0.704553 | 0.134958 | 0.112798 |

## Bonus Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | part_accuracy | part_accuracy_macro_team | part_accuracy_macro_game | part_accuracy_macro_bonus | exact_acc | ppb_mae |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.922341 | 0.361265 | 0.0354595 | 0.839873 | 0.842249 | 0.840312 | 0.831943 | 0.580259 | 1.40142 |

Generated figures include aggregate and buzz-position-stratified reliability, tossup difficulty over empirical buzz locations, per-dimension difficulty overlays for multidim fits, predicted-versus-empirical buzz timing, bonus-score predictions, and player, tossup, bonus-part, and optional synergy parameter distributions.
