# Topic-Weighted CompIRT Experiment Report

**Evaluation regime: transductive temporal holdout.** Returning-player priors come from the training split, but question parameters are co-estimated on the test-split outcomes being scored (paper Section 4.2), so these metrics are not fully inductive predictions of unseen questions.

**Correctness calibration was fit on the scored outcomes.** This run learned a Platt scale/bias on the same split these metrics score, so tossup ECE and log loss are flattered by construction and are not comparable to uncalibrated runs.

## Tossup Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | accuracy | buzz_position_mae | buzz_position_median_absolute_error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.597349 | 0.527683 | 0.00240029 | 0.770367 | 0.146981 | 0.129307 |

## Bonus Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | part_accuracy | part_accuracy_macro_team | part_accuracy_macro_game | part_accuracy_macro_bonus | exact_acc | ppb_mae |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.924418 | 0.349253 | 0.0133964 | 0.844659 | 0.845921 | 0.84509 | 0.850455 | 0.589225 | 0.456804 |

Generated figures match the standard CompIRT evaluation set. The first-buzz timing replay uses the CAIMIRA topic-gap formula `sum_k r_jk * (theta_ik - d_jk(t))`.
