# Topic-Weighted CompIRT Experiment Report

**Evaluation regime: transductive temporal holdout.** Returning-player priors come from the training split, but question parameters are co-estimated on the test-split outcomes being scored (paper Section 4.2), so these metrics are not fully inductive predictions of unseen questions.

## Tossup Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | accuracy | buzz_position_mae | buzz_position_median_absolute_error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.648954 | 0.576641 | 0.120258 | 0.714239 | 0.145999 | 0.127428 |

## Bonus Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | part_accuracy | part_accuracy_macro_team | part_accuracy_macro_game | part_accuracy_macro_bonus | exact_acc | ppb_mae |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Generated figures match the standard CompIRT evaluation set. The first-buzz timing replay uses the CAIMIRA topic-gap formula `sum_k r_jk * (theta_ik - d_jk(t))`.

The dedicated TF-IDF replay applies saved signed adjustments `-tfidf_prefix_j(t) * sum_k r_jk lambda_k` to both effective difficulty and first-buzz timing.

## TF-IDF Cumulative-Difficulty Lambdas

One nonnegative `lambda_k` per topic coordinate scales the cumulative TF-IDF prefix mass that lowers effective difficulty (`d'_jk(t) = d_jk(t) - lambda_k * tfidf_prefix_j(t)`).
