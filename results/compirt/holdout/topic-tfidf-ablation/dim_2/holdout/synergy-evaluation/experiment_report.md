Generated figures match the standard CompIRT evaluation set. The first-buzz timing replay uses the CAIMIRA topic-gap formula `sum_k r_jk * (theta_ik - d_jk(t))`.

The dedicated TF-IDF replay applies saved signed adjustments `-tfidf_prefix_j(t) * sum_k r_jk lambda_k` to both effective difficulty and first-buzz timing.

## TF-IDF Cumulative-Difficulty Lambdas

One nonnegative `lambda_k` per topic coordinate scales the cumulative TF-IDF prefix mass that lowers effective difficulty (`d'_jk(t) = d_jk(t) - lambda_k * tfidf_prefix_j(t)`).
