# CompIRT Experiment Report

**Evaluation regime: in-sample fit.** Player and question parameters were estimated on the same observations these metrics score, so they are optimization and inspection diagnostics, not generalization estimates.

**Correctness calibration was fit on the scored outcomes.** This run learned a Platt scale/bias on the same split these metrics score, so tossup ECE and log loss are flattered by construction and are not comparable to uncalibrated runs.

## Tossup Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | accuracy | buzz_position_mae | buzz_position_median_absolute_error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.646145 | 0.559931 | 0.0147429 | 0.727708 | 0.129554 | 0.118104 |

## Bonus Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | part_accuracy | part_accuracy_macro_team | part_accuracy_macro_game | part_accuracy_macro_bonus | exact_acc | ppb_mae |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.934904 | 0.334292 | 0.0452835 | 0.857536 | 0.861976 | 0.858398 | 0.857024 | 0.623913 | 0.54484 |

Generated figures include aggregate and buzz-position-stratified reliability, tossup difficulty over empirical buzz locations, per-dimension difficulty overlays for multidim fits, predicted-versus-empirical buzz timing, bonus-score predictions, and player, tossup, bonus-part, and optional synergy parameter distributions.
