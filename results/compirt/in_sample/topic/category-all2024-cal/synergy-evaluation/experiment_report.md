# Topic-Weighted CompIRT Experiment Report

**Evaluation regime: in-sample fit.** Player and question parameters were estimated on the same observations these metrics score, so they are optimization and inspection diagnostics, not generalization estimates.

**Correctness calibration was fit on the scored outcomes.** This run learned a Platt scale/bias on the same split these metrics score, so tossup ECE and log loss are flattered by construction and are not comparable to uncalibrated runs.

## Tossup Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | accuracy | buzz_position_mae | buzz_position_median_absolute_error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.61389 | 0.527521 | 0.00542506 | 0.767458 | 0.141649 | 0.125685 |

## Bonus Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | part_accuracy | part_accuracy_macro_team | part_accuracy_macro_game | part_accuracy_macro_bonus | exact_acc | ppb_mae |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.919556 | 0.360456 | 0.011178 | 0.838575 | 0.840975 | 0.838776 | 0.841408 | 0.579518 | 0.583224 |

Generated figures match the standard CompIRT evaluation set. The first-buzz timing replay uses the CAIMIRA topic-gap formula `sum_k r_jk * (theta_ik - d_jk(t))`.
