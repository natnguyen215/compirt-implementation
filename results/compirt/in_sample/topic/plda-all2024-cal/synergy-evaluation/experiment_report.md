# Topic-Weighted CompIRT Experiment Report

**Evaluation regime: in-sample fit.** Player and question parameters were estimated on the same observations these metrics score, so they are optimization and inspection diagnostics, not generalization estimates.

**Correctness calibration was fit on the scored outcomes.** This run learned a Platt scale/bias on the same split these metrics score, so tossup ECE and log loss are flattered by construction and are not comparable to uncalibrated runs.

## Tossup Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | accuracy | buzz_position_mae | buzz_position_median_absolute_error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.631458 | 0.522886 | 0.0115755 | 0.767876 | 0.155549 | 0.140671 |

## Bonus Metrics

| auc | log_loss | ece | part_accuracy | part_accuracy_macro_team | part_accuracy_macro_game | part_accuracy_macro_bonus | exact_acc | ppb_mae |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.918246 | 0.364504 | 0.0177973 | 0.838125 | 0.840304 | 0.838457 | 0.840561 | 0.576663 | 0.533572 |

Generated figures match the standard CompIRT evaluation set. The first-buzz timing replay uses the CAIMIRA topic-gap formula `sum_k r_jk * (theta_ik - d_jk(t))`.
